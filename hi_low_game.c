  This is a simple guessing game, computer, that means your program will guess
  a number in the range >=0 to <100. Then it will ask the user to guess that number,
  since the number is < 100, a simple mathematics can tell us it will not take more
  than 7 steps to find the number that the program guessed actually. It is always
  possible to find the number in 7 steps, how come? That is a task too!

  Therefore, your program will provide 7 chances to the player, each time it
  will ask for the number, if the input number is larger than the number guessed by
  program it will simply print "your number is high", if the input number is low, the
  program should print "Your number is low", and if the number input exatly matches
  with that of program's number then it will print "Bingo!! you have won!", also
  it will print the number of steps that user took to find the number. On each failed
  attempt the program should print the number of chances remaining.

  If user fail to guess the number in 7 chances, the program will print
  "Game Over!!!, try to be Mathematical".
